When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   1.提交修改
   2.协同作业
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   1.有些修改想要只有自己能看到不想分享
   2.自己想保留自己更改的版本而不想使用协同开发的版本
   
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   1.github上fork别人的repository
   2.clone用于使用url把repository复制到主机
   3.branch在主机中修改的时候使用
   
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
   1.便于处比较，处理来自多个人的冲突性更改 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

   1.email
   2.每次改动前都要开会！？
   
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

   1.要改动多个地方；做非正式改动，测试用；需要和别人讨论，短时间无法确定改动
   2.直接在master改步骤少，快速见效；在其他分支改，保证不引入其他错误，主分支仍能运行，其他分支确定没问题再合并进来
